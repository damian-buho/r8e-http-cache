# Features

## Project Features

### Generic HTTP caching proxy

- Thin image on `o9s/nginx` (cross-namespace base); nginx runtime, modules, HTTP/3, precompression and env-config are inherited from the base — this image only adds the cache routing and tuning
- Listens on nginx port `${O9S_NGINX_HTTP_PORT}` — default `80`
- URL scheme `/{host}/{path}`: the first path segment is extracted as the upstream host, the remainder is proxied over HTTPS to `https://{host}{path}` (`.container/user/app/.config/includes/index/cache.nginx.j2`)
- Missing first path segment → `400`; redirects (301/302/303/307/308) are followed internally via an `@redirect` location rather than passed to the client
- Response headers added `always`: `X-Cache-Status` (`$upstream_cache_status`), `X-Upstream-Host`, `X-Upstream-Target`, `X-Upstream-Redirect`
- Cache zone `proxy-cache`, cache key `$scheme$proxy_host$request_uri`; selected by `O9S_NGINX_INDEX_TYPE=cache`
- Traefik enabled: router `r8e-http-cache` on `` Host(`http-cache.docker.localhost`) ``, entrypoints `web,websecure`, `redirect-to-https@file` middleware, loadbalancer port `${O9S_NGINX_HTTP_PORT}`
- Cache tuning defaults set by this image (consumed by the inherited o9s/nginx env-config):
    - `O9S_NGINX_PROXY_CACHE_VALID_200=90d`, `O9S_NGINX_PROXY_CACHE_VALID_301=90d`, `O9S_NGINX_PROXY_CACHE_VALID_ANY=1m`
    - `O9S_NGINX_PROXY_CACHE_INACTIVE=90d`, `O9S_NGINX_PROXY_CACHE_KEYS_SIZE=8m`
    - `O9S_NGINX_PROXY_CACHE_LOCK=on`, `O9S_NGINX_PROXY_CACHE_LOCK_TIMEOUT=300s`
    - `O9S_NGINX_PROXY_CACHE_REVALIDATE=on`, `O9S_NGINX_PROXY_CACHE_USE_STALE=updating`, `O9S_NGINX_PROXY_CACHE_BACKGROUND_UPDATE=on`
    - `O9S_NGINX_PROXY_BUFFERS_NUM=32`, `O9S_NGINX_PROXY_BUFFERS_SIZE=64k`, `O9S_NGINX_PROXY_BUFFER_SIZE=16k`, `O9S_NGINX_PROXY_MAX_TEMP_FILE_SIZE=1024m`
    - `O9S_NGINX_PROXY_FORCE_RANGES=on`, `O9S_NGINX_PROXY_IGNORE_CLIENT_ABORT=on`, `O9S_NGINX_PROXY_INTERCEPT_ERRORS=on`, `O9S_NGINX_PROXY_SSL_SERVER_NAME=on`, `O9S_NGINX_RECURSIVE_ERROR_PAGES=on`

## Inherited from B19/Ubuntu 1.4.1

### Persistent APT cache across builds

- APT package and index caches survive across builds via BuildKit cache mounts, keyed by Ubuntu series and architecture.
- Repeated builds reuse downloaded packages instead of re-downloading.
- Optional LAN APT cacher proxy, enabled by setting `M6E_APT_CACHE_HOST`.

### Service process management with log routing (b19-exec)

- Long-running processes (daemons, servers) have stdout and stderr automatically routed through the structured logger.
- The service PID is tracked for signal forwarding — Docker stop gracefully terminates the main process.
- Log levels for stdout and stderr streams are independently configurable.
- Exit code of the service is captured and available to downstream hooks.

### Cached artifact downloads with integrity verification (b19-fetch)

- All external downloads go through a three-tier cache: local `.fetch/` directory, BuildKit persistent cache, then upstream via aria2c with up to 16 connections.
- Optional SHA-512 verification at every tier; hash mismatch causes fallthrough to the next tier rather than failure.
- Offgrid mode blocks all downloads entirely, failing fast with a clear error if a cache miss occurs.
- Supports a near-cache proxy for LAN-only builds that route through a caching proxy.

### Timed command execution with failure reporting (b19-run)

- Any command can be wrapped to get automatic elapsed-time measurement and success/failure reporting.
- Success output is visible only at higher verbosity levels; failure output is always shown.
- In debug mode, command output streams live instead of being buffered.

### Run-once initialization (bootstrap.d)

- One-time setup tasks (database migrations, admin user creation, directory init) run on first container start only.
- Automatic idempotency: completed scripts are never re-run, even across container restarts.
- Failed scripts are retried on next start; successful ones stay locked.
- State can be reset by clearing a volume, triggering a full re-bootstrap.
- Downstream images add their own init scripts by dropping them into a directory.

### Modular build hooks (build.d)

- All image build logic lives in numbered shell scripts instead of inline Dockerfile `RUN` commands.
- Hooks are organized in `pre/on/post` phases and auto-discovered by the stage name passed to `build-stage`.
- The reserved `always/{pre,post}` scope brackets every stage, whatever it is named, so cross-cutting setup is written once instead of per stage.
- Inheritable hooks propagate to downstream images automatically via Docker layer overlay — downstream gets parent’s build logic for free.
- Non-inheritable hooks are cleaned up after execution to prevent leaking into later stages.

### Automatic CPU count detection (NUMPROCS)

- Available CPUs are detected automatically with Kubernetes downward API, cgroups v2, or `nproc` fallback.
- The detected count is available as `NUMPROCS` throughout the build and runtime, used for parallel compilation, template rendering, and test execution.
- Eliminates hardcoded job counts and ensures consistent parallelism across Docker, Kubernetes, and CI.

### Declarative dependency management (b19-deps)

- External dependency metadata (URL, version, SHA-512 hash) stored as plain text files, completely separate from build scripts.
- Supports architecture-specific downloads, multi-version series, and nested component paths.
- Dependencies are auto-discovered at Makefile parse time — add files to the right directory and the build picks them up without manual declarations.
- `make fetch` pre-downloads everything for offline builds; version bumps trigger automatic re-fetch and hash updates.

### Pluggable startup system (entrypoint.d)

- Every container startup runs through a sequence of numbered hooks: signal setup, secrets loading, CPU detection, port validation, template rendering, bootstrap, service start.
- Ad-hoc commands (`docker run img command`) automatically bypass part of the startup chain and execute directly.
- Individual hooks or the entire entrypoint can be skipped at runtime via environment variables, no image rebuild needed.
- Downstream images override a single hook (slot 5000) to launch their service; everything else is inherited.

### Feature toggles for all subsystems

- Every major subsystem (entrypoint, healthchecks, bootstrap, tests, secrets, port validation, i18n, shell hooks) can be disabled at runtime via environment variables.
- Individual entrypoint and bootstrap hooks can be skipped by name without disabling the whole subsystem.
- No image rebuild required — toggles are runtime-only.

### Built-in health monitoring (healthcheck.d)

- Docker-native healthcheck declared in the base image and inherited by all downstream images with no extra configuration.
- Seven default checks: disk space on home, cache, and temp directories; HTTPS connectivity, DNS resolution, ICMP ping; and filesystem writability.
- Network checks are fault-tolerant — success on any target counts as pass.
- All network checks automatically skip in offgrid mode; all checks can be disabled at runtime.
- Downstream images add service-specific checks (HTTP endpoints, database connections, process liveness) by dropping scripts into a directory.

### Multilingual shell output (b19-i18n)

- All user-facing log messages and script output are translatable via GNU gettext.
- Ships with English, Spanish (`es_CL`), and Ukrainian (`uk_UA`) out of the box.
- Downstream images inherit all parent translations automatically; only new or overridden strings need translating.
- Translations are compiled at build time with no runtime overhead.

### Image lineage tracking

- Every image records its build metadata (namespace, project, version, base image) into a lineage file during build.
- Downstream images chain lineage from their parent, producing a full base-to-current provenance chain.
- The full lineage chain is logged at startup (debug verbosity) and readable from the file at any time, making it easy to trace what a running container was built from.

### Structured, level-filtered logging (b19-log)

- All container output goes through a leveled logger with four thresholds: error, warn, info, debug.
- Messages below the configured verbosity are silently discarded, keeping production logs clean.
- Colors auto-detect terminal support and respect `NO_COLOR=1`.
- Pipable: command output can be routed through the logger to apply level filtering and tags.

### Non-root container by default

- The container runs as a non-root user (`ubuntu`, UID/GID 1000) with all runtime files owned by that user.
- A two-stage build separates root-level system installation from user-level runtime setup.
- User identity is configurable at build time.

### Air-gapped / offline build and runtime support

- A single environment variable (`B19_OFFGRID_MODE=Y`) cuts all internet access at build time and runtime.
- Build-time: downloads are blocked, APT updates are skipped, SSH keyscans are skipped. All artifacts must come from cache tiers.
- Runtime: network healthchecks automatically skip with a healthy result, so containers stay green on isolated networks.
- APT package lists can be snapshotted and injected for fully offline image builds.
- LAN services (caching proxies, registries) remain reachable — offgrid blocks internet, not all networking.

### Runtime overlay injection

- Configuration or data files can be injected at container startup by setting `B19_OVERLAY` to a directory name.
- Overlay contents are recursively copied to the container root, overwriting existing files — no image rebuild needed.
- Skipped in immutable mode, preventing runtime modification of production-locked images.

### Reproducible base image (pinned by digest)

- The Ubuntu base image is pinned by SHA-256 digest, not by tag, ensuring deterministic builds.
- Supports multiple Ubuntu series (resolute, noble, jammy) selectable at build time.
- APT mirrors are configurable per architecture for LAN mirrors or air-gapped environments.

### Port validation

- Every environment variable whose name ends in `PORT` is validated at startup against the WHATWG blocklist of forbidden ports and privileged ports (\<1024).
- Catches misconfigurations like `HTTP_PORT=22` early, before the service fails silently.
- Can be disabled at runtime without rebuilding the image.

### Unified lifecycle runner family

- Eight numbered-hook runners cover the full container lifecycle: startup, healthchecks, tests, bootstrap, build hooks, benchmarks, reports, and shell sessions.
- All runners share the same pattern: drop a numbered script into a directory, it is auto-discovered and executed.
- Scripts from different image layers merge — upstream and downstream hooks coexist without conflict.
- Each runner has tailored failure semantics: abort on error (entrypoint, bootstrap), continue and count failures (healthchecks, tests), always succeed (reports).

### Docker secrets auto-loading (secrets)

- Docker secrets files are automatically discovered and converted to environment variables at startup.
- Dot-notation filenames map to uppercase env vars (`b19.npm.registry_host` becomes `B19_NPM_REGISTRY_HOST`).
- Required secrets can be declared by name; the container refuses to start if any are missing.
- Existing environment variables take precedence over secret-derived values.
- Secrets are also available in interactive shell sessions and healthchecks.
- Non-UTF-8/binary secrets (keys, DER blobs, gzipped tarballs) are **not** exported as env vars: Bash truncates them at the first NUL and the stray bytes panic any tool that reads the environment as UTF-8 (e.g. `minijinja --env`, used to template configs). They remain on disk at `/run/secrets/<name>` for file-based reads — which is the only correct way to consume a binary secret anyway.

### Interactive shell hooks (shell.d)

- `docker exec bash` sessions automatically load Docker secrets and any custom hooks added by downstream images.
- Hooks merge via Docker layer overlay, so inherited and project-specific shell setup coexist.

### Graceful signal handling

- PID 1 is `tini -g`, which reaps zombie processes and forwards signals to the full process group.
- A configurable set of Unix signals (TERM, INT, HUP, USR1, USR2, etc.) is trapped and forwarded to the main service process.
- `docker stop` cleanly terminates the service without orphan processes or signal loss.

### Jinja2 configuration templates (minijinja-cli)

- Jinja2-compatible template rendering at both build time and container startup.
- Drop a `.j2` file anywhere in the app directory; it is discovered at build time and rendered at every startup with all environment variables available.
- Runtime rendering is parallel and automatic — downstream images get it with zero configuration.
- Immutable mode (`B19_IMMUTABLE=Y`) locks the filesystem to build-time state, skipping all runtime rendering.

### Built-in test framework (test.d)

- Tests run inside the running container via `make test` or `docker exec`.
- Automatically waits for healthchecks to pass before executing.
- No test framework dependency — tests are plain shell scripts with exit codes.
- Supports Jinja2 templates in tests, useful for asserting build-time values at runtime.
- Continues on failure and reports the total count; never hides partial results.

### Pre-installed utility tools

- `mold` as default linker (opt-out available).
- `fd` for file finding, `minijinja-cli` for template rendering.
- `aria2c` for multi-connection downloads, `tini` as PID 1 for zombie reaping.
- Parallel compression tools: `pbzip2`, `pigz`, `pixz`.
- gettext tools for i18n compilation, `cURL` for network operations.

### XDG Base Directory paths

- Standard XDG paths (`XDG_CACHE_HOME`, `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, `XDG_DATA_HOME`, `XDG_STATE_HOME`) are set under the app home directory.
- All paths are writable by the non-root user without privilege escalation.
